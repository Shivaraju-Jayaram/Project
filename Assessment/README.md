# Car Data Analysis

## Overview of Datasets
This collection consists of three interrelated datasets that provide comprehensive information about buyers, their associated cars, and the companies that manufacture those cars. Together, these datasets can be utilized for various analyses, including customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and industry insights.

## Conclusion:
* The Power BI assessment focused on creating dynamic, interactive reports, leveraging advanced DAX calculations and visual customization to meet specific data-driven requirements. 🛠️

* One of the key tasks was configuring bookmarks to toggle between views for People and Product sales while retaining the selected state when opening a filter pop-up window. This involved precise management of bookmark groups, showcasing a deep understanding of user experience and interactivity in Power BI. 📊🔄

* The use of DAX to create calculated columns and measures was central to the assessment. Notably, retrieving the latest car purchase date for each buyer through DAX functions like MAX and ALLEXCEPT demonstrated a strong grasp of data manipulation. 🕰️🚗 

* Customizing slicers and dynamically updating slicer titles based on user interaction added another layer of complexity. A key accomplishment was making the slicer title display the selected range dynamically, improving user clarity. This required understanding Power BI’s contextual filtering behavior and showcased your expertise in designing user-friendly reports. 🖼️🎯

* We also tackled conditional formatting to enhance visual interactivity, using color changes to indicate active slicers. Moreover, calculating the make year with the highest average price and determining the most popular car brand by gender involved complex DAX aggregations, offering valuable business insights. 🚘🏆

* In summary, this project combined technical skills with creative report design. I excelled in using DAX, Power BI's interactive features, and creating polished reports that deliver actionable insights. The assessment highlights my proficiency in transforming raw data into clear, business-focused visualizations. 🚀📊✨
