I performed an in-depth analysis of chocolate sales data using Power BI, focusing on time-based insights, performance metrics, and visual storytelling. This project showcases various Power BI features like calculated measures, DAX-driven interactivity, and dynamic visual designs. Below are the key highlights and functionalities implemented:

### Date Table for Time Analysis: 📅

Total Sales 💰, Total Shipments 🚚, Total Cost 🏷️, Total Profit 📊
Less Box Shipments: Identified shipments with fewer than 50 boxes.
Profit % 📈 and LBS % metrics to monitor key performance indicators.

Created a field parameter slicer that lets users switch between sales, boxes, cost, shipments, and profit dynamically with DAX-driven accent bar colors to highlight the selected metric.


### Gauge Chart for KPIs: 🎯 
Visualized Profit % and LBS % in a dynamic Gauge Chart to give a clear overview of performance against targets.
