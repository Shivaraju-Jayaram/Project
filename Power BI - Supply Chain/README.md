## 📁 Project Overview
This project is aimed at helping AtliQ Mart, a rapidly growing FMCG company, improve its On-Time In-Full (OTIF) delivery metrics to enhance customer service. As part of the Supply Chain team, Peter Pandey (our role) has been tasked with building an interactive Power BI dashboard to track and analyze these metrics on a daily basis.

## 🏆 Problem Statement
AtliQ Mart is expanding to Tier 1 cities but facing challenges with customer retention due to service issues, especially regarding delayed or incomplete deliveries. To address this, Peter has been briefed to:
* Create metrics to measure the ```OT%```, ```IF%```, and ```OTIF%``` daily for each customer.
* Design a dashboard that fulfills stakeholders’ business requirements.
* Generate additional insights to identify trends and anticipate future service issues.

## 📋 Task Summary
* **Metrics Creation:** Set up KPIs to track ```OT%```, ```IF%```, and ```OTIF%```.
* **Dashboard Design:** Use Power BI bookmarks for toggling between different views and arrange the charts for optimal user experience.
* **Data Modeling:** Process and organize data to support dashboard visualizations and metrics calculations.
* **Additional Insights:** Add insights beyond the stakeholders’ requirements to highlight patterns in the data.
* **KPI Indicators:** Use colored arrows to signify KPI performance.

## ⚙️ Features & Functionality
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Developed with multiple visualizations to track OTIF metrics.
* **Bookmark Navigation:** Implemented bookmarks for seamless toggling between chart views.
* **KPI Performance Indicators:** Colored arrows provide quick insights into performance trends.
* **Date Modelling Enhancements:** Added date columns to enhance time-based analyses.
* **Visually Optimized:** Designed for clarity, with a focus on usability and insight discovery.

## 📊 Dashboard Structure
1. Metrics Overview

        Track OT%, IF%, and OTIF% across different dimensions (city, customer, and product).
        Compare against target service levels for quick reference.
        Interactive Charts

2. Toggle visibility of different charts using bookmarks.

        Drill-down options for exploring specific cities (Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara) and customer service metrics.
        
3. Performance Indicators

        Colored arrows visually indicate KPIs relative to target values.

## 📈 Key Insights
Developed insights beyond the primary metrics to uncover trends and highlight potential areas for improvement.
Used data modeling techniques to create a robust structure for dashboard analytics and KPIs.

## 🚀 Getting Started
* **Data Preparation:** Use the metadata and notes provided in the project files.
* **Open Power BI File:** Launch the Power BI file, which includes pre-modeled data and the interactive dashboard.
* **Explore:** Navigate through the metrics, charts, and insights as per stakeholder needs.

## 📦 Resources Provided
