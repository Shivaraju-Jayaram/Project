# AtliQo Telecom KPI Analysis Dashboard
## Project Overview
**Domain:** Telecom
**Function:** Executive Management

**AtliQo**, a prominent telecom provider in India, launched its 5G plans in May 2022. Since then, the management has observed a decline in active users and revenue growth. They requested the analytics team to compare key performance indicators (KPIs) for the pre- and post-5G launch periods to identify trends and support data-driven decision-making to improve user engagement and optimize plan offerings. <br>This project is executed as part of CodeBasics' resume-building challenge for aspiring data analysts.

## Objective:
Develop an intuitive, self-explanatory Power BI dashboard to present the pre- and post-5G launch KPI comparison and actionable insights to AtliQo’s top-level management.

## Key Features
* **Slicer Panel with Bookmarks:** Created slicer panels for each category in the mock-up dashboard, enabling quick filtering for easy comparison.
* **Date Table Enhancements:** Added additional columns to the date table to support time-based analysis.
* **Tooltip Visualization:** Developed tooltip pie charts for line charts to enhance monthly performance comparison and allow a quick drill-down into specific metrics.
* **Dashboard Enhancements:** Aligned visualizations with the mock-up requirements while optimizing them for executive review.

## Data Sources and Resources
**Metrics List:** Provided metrics were used and additional metrics created based on insights required.<br>
